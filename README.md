# Linkin-Park---DataSet
 really like this group, Linkin Park. Now they are back with a new composer, Emili Armstrong, who replaced Chester Bennington, the best singer in my opinion.

You might think that this is the best moment to analyze the trajectory of Linkin Park through the years. So, this work showcases my ability to clean the dataset and create insightful visualizations about the key parameters of this group, in my opinion.
